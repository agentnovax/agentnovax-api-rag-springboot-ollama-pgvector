# üöÄ **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

## Overview

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) technique that combines **retrieval-based** and **generation-based** methods to significantly enhance the performance of language models for tasks like **question answering**, **text generation**, and **semantic search**. RAG integrates two key components: **retrieving relevant information** from a knowledge base or corpus and **generating meaningful content** based on that information.

---

### Key Concepts of RAG:

#### 1. **üîç Retrieval-Based Methods**:
- In this step, relevant information is retrieved from a **large corpus of text** or database based on the input query. This is typically done by converting the input into an **embedding** and searching for the most relevant documents or pieces of text using vector databases.
- Example: For a query like *"What is the capital of France?"*, the system retrieves relevant passages like "The capital of France is Paris."

#### 2. **üìù Generation-Based Methods**:
- After retrieving the relevant documents or text, a **language model** (like **GPT-3**, **T5**, or **BERT**) is used to **generate a response** based on the retrieved content. This is the "augmented generation" step where the model synthesizes the retrieved data into a coherent, informative response.

---

### Architecture of RAG:

#### 1. **üîÑ Retrieval**:
- The input query (e.g., *"What is the capital of France?"*) is converted into an **embedding** using a pre-trained model like **BERT** or **MiniLM**.
- The embedding is then used to search a vector database (e.g., **PGVector**, **FAISS**, **Elasticsearch**) for the most relevant documents.

#### 2. **üß† Augmentation**:
- Once relevant documents are retrieved, a **generation model** (e.g., **GPT-3**, **T5**, or **BART**) takes the input query along with the retrieved documents to generate a complete, contextually relevant response.

#### 3. **üí° Combination**:
- By combining retrieval and generation, RAG enhances the **accuracy** and **relevance** of responses. The generation model is augmented with dynamic, up-to-date information, allowing the model to provide more informed and accurate answers.

---

## Advantages of RAG

- **‚ö° Enhanced Accuracy**: The retrieval mechanism allows the model to access more accurate and context-specific information, improving response quality.
- **üìö Dynamic Knowledge**: Instead of relying solely on fixed pre-trained knowledge, RAG can use **real-time external information** retrieved from documents or databases.
- **üåê Open-Domain Performance**: RAG excels in open-domain tasks like **question answering** and **semantic search**, where the model needs to answer queries based on external information.

---

## Use Cases

RAG can be used across a variety of applications, including:

- **‚ùì Question Answering (QA)**:
    - Provides more precise and relevant answers by retrieving information from a knowledge base or external documents.

- **üí¨ Dialogue Systems**:
    - Enhances conversational AI systems by retrieving related documents and generating more informed, context-aware responses.

- **üìë Summarization**:
    - Retrieves relevant content from long documents and generates concise summaries.

---

## Example of RAG in Action:

1. **Input**:
    - *"What is the capital of France?"*

2. **üîç Retrieval**:
    - The system retrieves relevant documents, such as:
        - "The capital of France is Paris."

3. **üìù Generation**:
    - Using the retrieved data, the model generates a response:
        - "The capital of France is Paris."

---

## Conclusion

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a powerful technique that enhances the generation process by combining the strengths of both **retrieval** and **generation**. By leveraging real-time information retrieval, RAG can provide better performance for tasks like **question answering**, **semantic search**, and **text generation**, making it an invaluable tool for NLP applications.
**Although we are using a smaller model to in this set up locally however ollama allows you to use any model for instance llama 2 or llama 3 with much larger parameters but is not recommended to run larger model locally without going thorough minimum system requirement**. We can even use the existing large models like GPT to make use their wide parameters in case model can't be host locally.

## Installation üèóÔ∏è

### Step 1: Set Up PostgreSQL üóÉÔ∏è

#### 1. Install PostgreSQL
- **Windows**:
    - Download the installer from the [official site](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
    - Follow the installation instructions.
    - Set up a password for the `postgres` user during installation.
- **Linux**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
  ```
- **macOS**:
  ```bash
  brew install postgresql
  ```

#### 2. Start PostgreSQL Service
- **Windows**: Use **pgAdmin** or start the service from the services tab.
- **Linux/macOS**:
  ```bash
  sudo service postgresql start
  ```

#### 3. Create a Database and enable vector extension
- Access the PostgreSQL shell:
  ```bash
  psql -U postgres
  ```
- Create a database and tables using the script in [`schema.sql`](docker/schema.sql):
  ```postgresql
  CREATE DATABASE "postgres"
  WITH OWNER = postgres ENCODING = 'UTF8';
  ```

- Exit the shell:
  ```sql
  \q
  ```

### Step 2: Set Up Docker üö¢
### 2. Docker Setup

#### 2.1 **Dockerize the Spring Boot Application**

Ensure your Spring Boot application is properly configured and can run in a Docker container. Update configuration inside [**Dockerfile**](docker/Dockerfile) and [**docker-compose**](docker/docker-compose.yml) setup for Spring Boot.

#### 2.2 **Customise Postgres image**

Update postgres configuration inside [**Dockerfile**](docker/postgres/Dockerfile) and [**custom-postgresql**](docker/postgres/custom-postgresql.conf) setup for Postgres SQL with Vector.

#### 2.3 **Customise Ollama image and install custom model**

Update ollama configuration inside [**Dockerfile**](docker/ollama/Dockerfile) and [**start-ollama**](docker/ollama/start-ollama.sh) setup for ollama with all-minilm model locally we can skip this step and can directly use available larger model API likes GPT for specific use cases.

Update the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:
```properties

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://database:5432/postgres
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=postgres
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

ollama.model=all-minilm
ollama.embeddingURL="http://ollama:11434/api/embed"
```

### 3. Build and Run üöÄ

Once all the configurations are set, follow these steps to run the project:

1. **Build the Spring Boot Application**:

```bash
./mvnw clean package
```
or (**Gradle**)
```bash
./gradlew bootJar
```

2. **Start the Docker Containers**:

```bash
